# Logo_Creation_Homework
  ## Description
  This week's challenge was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as "logo.svg" in the example folder. The application prompts the user to provide text for the logo, decide the color of the text and the shape, and finally save the generated SVG file as "logo.svg".
